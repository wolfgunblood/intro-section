## Overview

The introduction page serves as the initial point of contact for users and provides a compelling overview of the website or application. It is designed to captivate and engage visitors right from the start. The page typically includes a combination of visually appealing graphics, concise and impactful text, and intuitive navigation elements. It aims to convey the core message and purpose of the website, highlighting its unique features and benefits. Through a carefully crafted layout and design, the introduction page entices users to explore further and encourages them to take desired actions such as signing up, downloading an app, or accessing additional content. It sets the tone for the overall user experience and plays a crucial role in making a positive first impression.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the relevant dropdown menus on desktop and mobile when interacting with the navigation links
- View the optimal layout for the content depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
